## 🧩 Inspiration

Dyslexia affects over 700 million people worldwide — but most tools are generic or overwhelming. We wanted to build a **compassionate, accessible, and personalized** app to help people navigate reading, writing, and life with ease.

LexiPal was born from the belief that tech can be a **friend** — not a barrier — for learners with different needs.

## 🧠 What We Learned

- Designing for neurodiversity involves **simplicity, empathy, and adaptability**.
- Speech and accessibility APIs can create meaningful change when used well.
- Fast prototyping using Bolt + Supabase can enable full-stack apps in hours.

## ⛅ Challenges We Faced

- Designing a dashboard friendly to all dyslexic types: visual, auditory, and processing.
- Making voice features intuitive while being fail-safe.
- Customizing layout and fonts to be **dyslexia-friendly** and distraction-free.
